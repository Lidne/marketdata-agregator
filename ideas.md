Rough ideas on the project (probably todo list):
- Base/core:
    - [ ] Storing assets' info
    - [ ] Storing market data
    - [ ] Basic CRUD API
- Cool stuff to add: 
    - [ ] Realtime market data agregation and db updates through kafka stream (look oko)
    - [ ] API cache through redis
    - [ ] Query API with (semi-)custom query language
