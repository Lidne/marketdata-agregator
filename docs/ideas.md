Rough ideas on the project (probably todo list):

- Base/core:
  - [x] Storing assets' info
  - [x] Storing market data
  - [x] Basic CRUD API
  - [x] API cache through redis
- Cool stuff to add:
  - [ ] Realtime market data agregation and db updates through kafka stream (look oko)
  - [ ] Query API with (semi-)custom query language
